3. Use CSS to replicate a given design prototype.

**Page resembles card from design prototype.**

- The text is italicized for the animal’s interesting fact.
- The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items.
- The dots are removed from the animal's list items.
- Uses border around animal’s name, image, and information (interesting fact, list items, and description).
- Uses border around animal’s information.
- Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information.
- Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side. Card should not expand with the browser window).
- Feel free to customize your information and styles so long as you follow the above rules. For inspiration, you can try playing around with background colors or border radius!

Customize web page content (such as images and text) while working within the constraints of a given design.

The placeholder image and information is replaced with favorite animal image and information.

The image is 300px wide or the image's width is set to 300px.

The image’s alt is relevant to the animal used.

3. Use CSS classes to apply styles to HTML elements.

**The HTML includes classes that are used for styling.**

- Classes are given meaningful names.
- Fully separate the CSS-defined styles of a web page from that page's HTML-defined structure.
- The page fully separates the HTML from the CSS by linking to a stylesheet.
- The HTML code does not include <style> elements or style attributes in the body.
- Apply basic formatting and indentation to HTML and CSS code for readability.
- Code is ready for review, meaning new lines and indentation are used for easy readability.

**Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!**

To take your submission to the next level, you can add additional customizations to your card. As long as you include all of the above, you're welcome (and encouraged) to play with the styles and adjust the design.

**For inspiration, here are some ideas:**

- Change the background colors or border-radius.
- Add a box shadow on the entire card.
- If you really want to challenge yourself, you could try creating multiple cards that are all displayed on the same page—and you could even use flexbox to adjust how they get displayed when the page is resized.
